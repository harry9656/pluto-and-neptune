# Pluto and Neptune
This webpage is about Pluto and Neptune. Not a textbook description of the two planets but a made up story of how Pluto and Neptune met. 

This webpage uses AngularJs and for the scroll effect, uses [ng smooth scroll plugin](http://github.com/d-oliveros/ngSmoothScroll). Also a new thing is at the end of the page, I used a background video which shows them together bouncing up and down. Pluto and Neptune were made in Blender 3D with a low polygon count.
